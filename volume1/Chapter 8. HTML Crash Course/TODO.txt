Exercises
1.	Write an HTML code for a login form. Do not create any actions. The form should have the appropriate labels, user/email input, password input, remember me checkbox, and buttons for login with social media. You should also add the proper labels and validations. Additionally, use the appropriate attributes to hint the user at the valid data that should be entered.
2.	Create a new page simulating a registration form. It should require email, password, country (you need to provide a list of countries from a dropdown), zip, city, address, and optionally phone number. Use the most appropriate HTML tags and add all the attributes that you can think of to ease the page's usage and security.
